# GreenTribe

# Web Design Proposal

Sustainable wood growing and forest conservation goes hand in hand. Most of the devastating effects happen in the underdeveloped countries. One might think that local campaigns in a country may not directly affect this hazard. However, one would be entirely wrong. Most of the demand for consumer goods (using ingredients that may in one way or another create deforestation) and wood products which require the destruction of these forests in the underdeveloped countries come from us in the developed countries (Morris 2007).

The aim of this project is to raise awareness among UK consumers which also extends purchasing consumer goods from brands that support sustainable worldwide wood growing. 

As I am located here in London, there are many ways to educate consumers and shift their demands to purchase goods from sustainable sources (Housel 2017).

I’ve chosen a UK organisation “WWF” as the framework for my project. 

 The scope of the website offers content about different aspects of environment and species conservation. To comply with the specifics, the focus will mainly be on the subpage about forest (WWF 2018). However, this will also extend to other pages on the website related to sustainable wood growing and forest conservation efforts.

What strikes me the most is how clean the website looks, how easy it is to navigate around, the appeal of the images, and the just-enough amount of content that is not overwhelming. The setup effectively captures audience’s attention and keeps them engaged while encourages further navigation throughout the website.

The focus:
- benefits of forests both micro and macro
- effects of deforestation on locals and wildlife
- effects of purchasing consumer goods that support deforestation
- how to avoid these effects
Better practice:
- purchase consumer goods from sustainable suppliers. Directories of goods that support forest sustainability (advertising revenue stream)

# # Table 2 – Competitive Analysis Summary
Comparison gives us an understanding of what the new website will and won’t include. The most important part is to build a website the has an effective content hierarchyand clutter-free with informative headers that can be easily scanned. The style guide should give a clean and easy-on-the-eye look. The branding must portray a sense of credibility through credentials shown on the website. All links and images should have descriptive captions. Important call-to-action buttons must be prominent across the website. The main navigation bar should exude simplicity to avoid intimidating users which could prohibit them from exploring the website as planned. The navigation process must be streamlined, leading users to the destination with expected commands. Call-to-action forms must be easy to fill without too many questions and must have secure online payment methods. The website should be responsive and displays high quality content on different browsers and devices.
Important aspects to avoid includes using outdated design and overwhelming users with a lot of texts in one section.

# Web Technologies Recommendations

# # Choice of URL:
URL should represent a sense of fun and unity. We should choose a “.org” URL to represent a non-profit organisation according to the goal of the company.
URL available is www.greentribe.org

# # Service Provider: 
To provide strong credibility and website security image to users, the scheme type of internet service will be “https”. The encryption makes sure that users’ information remains confidential from prying eyes on the internet and enhance users’ confidence via complete privacy control.  With website’s integrity enhanced, SEO optimisation will also be more effectively. We will use Bluehost service provider who is a reputable company offering encrypted hosting at a competitive price (Bluehost, 2018).

# # Technology Stack:
A static website which is easy to browse with added secure online payment options. This is a simple website requiring standard CMS software. We will also aim for low latency and highly responsive performance aspect. There should be an easy-to-manage CMS system for the client to conveniently update new content. 
Due to the expected growth of users in the future, the website must be able to handle horizontal scalability as the user number increases. The website should also be able to collect user information as a database for future development. 

# # Recommended technology stack is:
-	HTML5
-	CSS & Bootstrap
-	JavaScript & JQuery
-	React.js
-	Nginx
-	Python
-	Django
-	MySQL
-	Redis

# # Method of implementation:
This will start with structural design through wireframe and prototyping while gathering high quality media and text content followed by front-end and user-experience visual element design to comply with the branding goal. During this phase, we will use tools such as style tiles and mood board to support the process. Once this is satisfied, we will begin coding and testing phase and eventually host the website.  
In terms of file transfer protocol, we will choose a secure server for transfer files and backup data which supports proxies and encryption. It will have an easy-to-use interface. The recommended software is “Win SCP” which also comes in a portable edition.


# Implementation and Testing:
Main page consists of subsections, some are anchored to the navigation bar:
1.	 Home section (anchored to “Green Tribe” logo and “Home” navigation tab)
2.	Crisis section (anchored to “Why We Plant” navigation tab)
3.	Statement section (not anchored)
4.	Where-We-Plant section (anchored to “Where We Plant” navigation tab)
5.	Stats section (not anchored)
6.	Take-Action section (anchored to “Take Action” navigation tab)
7.	Business Client section (not anchored)
8.	Team section (not anchored)
9.	Contact section (anchored to “Contact” navigation tab)
10.	Footer section (not anchored)

# # Home Section:
Home section consists of logo, navigation bar, video media, and a call-to-action button “€1 = ONE TREE” which in the future will lead to an individual donation page with options for the amount of donation and integrated secured online payment options.
-	The GreenTribe logo on the left corner is fixed to the entire homepage which will be shown even if user scroll down to other part of the page. When click on the logo, user will be directed back to the home section.
-	The short video is an animation that effectively shows what the website is about. First the clip shows trees which then disappear reflecting the crisis of deforestation. 
-	The call-to-action button “€1 = ONE TREE” changes colour to orange background with white text when hovered on. 
-	The arrow-down button at the bottom of this section is anchored to the “Crisis section”. It changed to orange when hovered and will direct users to this section on the main page when clicked on.

In addition, when a user scrolls down and away from the “Home section”, the navigation bar will still show throughout the whole page with the background colour changed to white background. The navigation tab also changes colour to yellow indicating the section that the user is on. 

# # Crisis Section:
This is prioritised as the most important section of the whole webpage after the home page -we are showing immediate current effects of deforestation and reforestation. As a result, arrow-down anchored tag on the “Home page” direct users here instantly. 
This section has its own tabs including “Crisis”, “Extinction”, “Tree Facts”, “Climate”. Once clicks on each tab, users are directed to the information specific to that tab. The tab colour also changes to orange indicating the tab in use. 
There is also a call-to-action button “Get Involved”. In the future, this button will lead users to a webpage providing information on how to donate as an individual or as a business partner. The background colour of the call-to-action button changes colour to orange when hovered on.

# # Take Action section:
To make the audience understand how they can support Green Tribe, this section is separated into 2 boxed – one for individuals and one for businesses. Each box has a brief explanation of how donation for each type works with transparent grey background for easy reading. 
When hovered on, each background changes to grey colour with “Get Involved” text box. In the future, each text box will be linked to another page with information on how individuals can support Green Tribe and how businesses can become our partners. 

# # Clients Section:

This allows user to learn more about our dedicated team behind the scene including their profiles and background.
Team section has a carousel with 6 boxes. Each box contains an image of a team member. There are small right and left arrows at the bottom of the carousel allowing users to scroll through all the team members.
When hovered on, the background for each box changes to transparent grey. The name and the role of the member appears along with social media links.
